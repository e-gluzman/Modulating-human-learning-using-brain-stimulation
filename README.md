# Modulating-human-learning-using-tDCS

This repository contains the MATLAB code for the probabilistic card game script and RL agent which were used in my experiment investigating the effect of brain stimulation on the ability of human participants to make optimal decisions in a probabilistic card game. 

Please see the MSc-Project-Thesis repository for a full summary of the project.

If you would like to request the full list of scripts, including data analysis and the regressions discussed in the report, please contact me at gluzman64@gmail.com
