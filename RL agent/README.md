This file contains MATLAB scripts used to run the reinforcement learning agent. 
These scripts were based on research conducted by Alon Baram at the University of Oxford. 
Alon proposed that we use the cross-term equations which allow the RL agent to update the value of a reward
based on changes in the value of related reward.

simulate.m allows to simulate the choices of an agent that is playing a probabilistic card game. The other scripts are used to fit the reinforcement learning model to the performance of human participants. 

The code here is mostly intended for illustrative purposes. If you would like to get it to work on your machine please email me at gluzman64@gmail.com and I can send you some mock data, additional scripts necessary to run this.
