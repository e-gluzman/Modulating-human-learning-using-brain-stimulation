This file contains MATLAB scripts used to run the reinforcement learning agent. 
These scripts were based on research conducted by Alon Baram at the University of Oxford. 
Alon proposed that we use the cross-term equations which allow the RL agent to update the value of a reward
based on changes in the value of related reward.
